#  Understand Different Types of Vulnerabilities


> [!multi-column]
>> [!check]+ Vulnerability Classification
>>- 1 Misconfigurations/weak configurations
>>- 2 Default installations/default configurations
>>- 3 Application flaws
>>- 4 Poor patch management
>>- 5 Design flaws
>>- 6 Operating system flaws
>>- 7 Default passwords
>>- 8 Zero-day vulnerabilities
>>- 9 Legacy platform vulnerabilities
>>- 10 System sprawl/undocumented assets
>>- 11 Improper certificate and key management
>>- 12 Third-party risks
>
>> [!warning]+ Misconfigurations(1)
>> - [ ] Misconfiguration is the most common vulnerability and is mainly caused by human error. It allows attackers to **break into a network** and gain unauthorized access to systems
>> #### Network Misconfigurations
>> - Insecure Protocols
>> - Open Ports and Services
>> - Errors
>> - Weak Encryption
>>#### Host Misconfigurations 
>> - Open Permissions
>> - Unsecured Root Accounts
>
>> [!todo]+ Application Flaws(3)
>>- Application flaws are **vulnerabilities** in appl ications t hat are exploited by the attackers
>>- Flawed applications pose security threats such as **data tampering** and **unauthorized access** to configuration stores
>> - [ ]  Buffer Overflows
>> - [ ] Memory Leaks
>> - [ ] Resource Exhaustion
>> - [ ] Integer Overflows
>> - [ ] Null Pointer /Object Dereference
>> - [ ] DLL Injection
>> - [ ] Race Conditions
>> - [ ] Time of Check/Time of Use
>> - [ ] Improper Input Handling
>> - [ ] Improper Error Handling


>[!hint]+ Default Installations/Default Configurations (2)
>- Default installations are usually **user-friendly** - especially when the device is being used for the first time when the primary concern is the **usability of the device** rather than the device's security
>- Failing to change the default settings while deploying the software or hardware  allows the attacker to **guess the settings** to break into the system
>- When connecting a system or device to a network, it is important to **disable unnecessary components** and services associated wit h the default configuration

>> [!note]+ Poor Patch Management(4)
>>- A patch is a **small piece of software** designed to fix problems, security vulnerabilities, and bugs as well as improve the usability or performance of a computer program or its supporting data 
>>- Software vendors provide patches that **prevent exploitations** and reduce the probability of threats exploiting a specific vulnerability 
>>- Unpatched software can make an application, server, or device vulnerable to various attacks
>>##### ဥပမာ
>>- Unpatched Servers
>>- Unpatched Firmware
>>- Un patched OS
>>- Unpatched Applications
>
>> [!warning]+ Design Flaws(5)
>>- Design vulnerabilities such as **incorrect encryption** or the poor validation of data refer to logical flaws in the functionality of the system that attackers exploit to bypass the **detection mechanism** and acquire access to a secure system 
>
>> [!todo]+ Operating System. Flaws(6)
>> - [ ]  Due to vulnerabilities in the operating systems, applications such as **Trojans, worms**, and viruses pose threats
>> - [ ] These attacks use malicious code, script, or unwanted software, which results in the **loss of sensitive information** and control of computer operations

>[!multi-column]
>>[!note]+ Default Passwords(7)
>>- Manufacturers provide users with default passwords to **access the device** during its initial set-up, which **users must change** for future use
>>- When users **forget to update** the passwords and continue using the default passwords, they make devices and systems vulnerable to various attacks such as **brute force** and **dictionary attacks**
>
>>[!warning]+ Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (8)
>>- known vulnerabilities in software/hardware that are **exposed** but **not yet patched**
>>- These vulnerabilities are **exploited by the attackers** before being acknowledged and patched by the software developers or **security analysts**
>
>>[!todo]+ Legacy Platform Vulnerabilities(9)
>> - [ ] Legacy platform vulnerabi lities are caused by **obsolete** or familiar codes
>> - [ ] Legacy platforms are usually **not supported** when patching technical assets such as smartphones, computers, loT devices, OSes, applications, databases, firewalls, IDSes, or other network components
>> - [ ] This type of vulnerabilities can cause **costly data breaches** for organizations

>[!multi-column]
>
>>[!note]+ System Sprawl/Undocumented Assets(10)
>>- The system sprawl vulnerability arises within an organizational network because of an increased number of **system or server connections** without proper documentation or an understanding of their maintenance
>>- These assets are often neglected over t ime, making t hem **susceptible to attacks**
>
>>[!warning]+ Improper Certificate and key Management (11)
>>- Improper certificate and key management may lead to many vulnerabilities that allow attackers to perform **password cracking** and **data exfiltration** attacks
>>- Storing or retaining legacy or **outdated keys** also poses major threats to organizations
>>- Private keys used with certificates must be stored in a **highly secured environment**; otherwise, an unauthorized individual can intercept the keys and gain access to confidential data or critical systems
>
>>[!todo]+ Third-party Risks (12)
>> - [ ] Third-party services or products can have **access to privileged systems** and **applications**, through which financial information, customer and employee data, and processes in the enterprise's supply chain can be compromised
>> ##### Examples of Third-party Rislts
>> - Vendor Management
>> - Supply-chain Risks
>> - Outsourced Code Development
>> - Data Storage
>> - Cloud-based vs On-premises Risks
